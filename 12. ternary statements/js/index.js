// ternary operator = a shortcut to if{} and else{} statements
//                    helps to assign a variable based on a condition
//                    condition? codeIfTrue : codeIfFalse;
//                    the point of this is to make a shortcut, programming is all about making the code as short as possible, meanwhile as efective as you can make it.
